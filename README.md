# üî¨ Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Onset: Statistical Analysis and LDA Classification (R)

### üåü Project Overview

This is the final project for the Statistics course, focusing on a comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling pipeline. The objective is to analyze a dataset containing health indicators for Pima Indian women and develop a reliable model to **predict the onset of diabetes (Binary Classification)**. The project emphasizes rigorous statistical methodologies, including data quality assessment, feature scaling (Z-Score Normalization), and the application of **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**.

### üéØ Key Objectives and Scientific Contributions

1.  **Rigorous Data Screening:** Conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check for data quality, feature distributions, and the presence of outliers.
2.  **Implementation of Classification Model:** Apply **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** to classify patients into "Diabetic" or "Non-Diabetic" groups based on health predictors.
3.  **Model Stability and Performance:** Assess the model's robustness by running the training and testing process **100 times** and calculating the **mean and standard deviation** of key performance metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-Score).

### üîë Performance and Findings

* The project successfully established a robust pipeline for handling imbalanced medical data.
* **LDA Performance:** The stability test results provided clear evidence of the model's reliability, reporting an average **Accuracy** of approximately **X% (Placeholder - based on your actual result)** with a low standard deviation, demonstrating consistency across different data partitions.
* **Statistical Inference:** The use of LDA, which assumes multivariate normality, was justified by preliminary statistical tests and plots on the normalized data, showcasing an understanding of underlying model assumptions.
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `Proposal/` folder, outlining the scientific background, methodology, and expected outcomes.
